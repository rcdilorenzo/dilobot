# DiloBot

This is the personal slackbot I use at my house. I use it to help my mother track academic data for my younger siblings. It may or may not interest you.

It is not intended to be a model of exemplary coding by any stretch of the imagination. If it works, we use it. If not, I fix it. :-)

If it's helpful to know, I run this on a Debian GNU/Linux install and have not tried it on other operating systems.

# Read it. Run it. Tweak it.

To run this app, you'll need to copy the `config/config.example.exs` to `config/config.exs` and add your own values there.

Aside from this, you'll need to do the typical installation necessary for elixir apps and make sure you have `phantomjs` and the various ruby packages listed as required in the `static/` ruby file(s).
